# Samples

Placeholder for people to contribute samples of metadata and files for their technologies and techniques.

Layout is largely a placeholder, but we should be very clear the provenance of any metadata / files, and include machine names/models if applicable.

Also be aware this repo is public, so please don't attach confidential data.
